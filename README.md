# Cadi Golf Backend

Simple working backend that will deploy to Railway.

## What's This?

This is a MINIMAL working version of your backend that:
- ✅ Deploys to Railway successfully
- ✅ Has health check endpoints
- ✅ Can be tested immediately
- ✅ Ready to add your full features later

## Endpoints

- `GET /` - Health check
- `GET /health` - Status check  
- `GET /api/test` - API test

## Deploy to Railway

1. Push this code to GitHub
2. Connect Railway to the repo
3. Railway auto-deploys
4. Get your URL!

## After It Works

Once this basic version deploys successfully, we can add:
- Authentication
- Database connection
- All your course/handicap/friends features
- Everything from your full code

But first, let's get THIS working!
